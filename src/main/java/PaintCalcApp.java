Exercise 9 - Paint Calculator
Sometimes you have to round up to the next number rather than follow standard rounding rules.

Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.

Example Output
You will need to purchase 2 gallons of paint to cover 360 square feet.

Remember, you canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must
round up to the next whole gallon.

Constraints
Use a constant to hold the conversion rate.
Ensure that you round up to the next whole number.
